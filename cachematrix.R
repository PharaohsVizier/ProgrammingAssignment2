## The two functions below work together to create and set a matrix and to solve and cache the inverse..  

## makeCacheMatrix sets up a matrix and creates methods to set and retrieve matrix values and set and retrieve the inverse.  
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## cacheSolve computers an inverse of the makeCacheMatrix, unless a cached version of the solution is found in which case it will returnn.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
